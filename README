This is a fork of the original PDP-10 macsyma to
make it run on Maclisp on the Multics operating system.

This is not the original Multics macsyma.

Installation:

move files from ecs, helpers and src into one directory

move files from documentation into one directory named documentation and
fix var macsyma-dir in multicsm.lisp for location of parent directory.

compile-all.ec compiles all lisp files

makemacsyma.ec generates a save file

Tests:

move files from the tests directory into a tests directory
and run run-tests.ec to run all tests. Not all succeed.
There are some deficiencies in comparing floating point results
and different implementation dependent ordering of terms in
results. But some seem to fail nevertheless.
